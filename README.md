## Executive Summary

- Architecture-first leader with deep experience in Enterprise Architecture, GRC and Cybersecurity, and large-scale modernization and program strategy. I translate complex systems into clear models that unify people, data, and technology into predictable, executable outcomes.
- Grounded in Business Architecture, I structure organizations into architectural viewpoints by mapping business entities into People Process Technology requirements supported by conceptual, logical, and physical models.
- I lead architecture, governance programs, evidence cycles, modernization roadmaps, and multi-team delivery structures across business, technology, security, and compliance, including Responsible AI governance and AI platform architecture that remain compliant, segmented, identity-centered, and audit-ready.

### Identity Statement

As an architecture-first leader, I specialize in transforming messy, high-risk environments into clear, risk-manageable, and executable models. My approach spans business, technology, security, and compliance, enabling teams to align quickly, make informed decisions, and deliver measurable outcomes. Grounded in Business Architecture and a People-Process-Technology lens, I translate ambiguity into conceptual, logical, and physical architectures that support modernization roadmaps, establish governance cadence, and enable audit-ready operations. I operate at the intersection of enterprise architecture, GRC, and program delivery, including Responsible AI governance and the design of segmented, identity-centered, and evidence-driven AI platform architectures. My style is practical and structured, positioning organizations for future-state execution and continuous improvement. 

### Top 3 Roles

- Principal / Enterprise Architect (Business, Solution, Infrastructure, AI-enabled): Turns complex ecosystems into conceptual, logical, and physical architectures that unify teams, drive modernization roadmaps, and safely integrate AI capabilities into the enterprise operating model, including data flows, identity, segmentation, and platform patterns.
- Director, GRC and Cybersecurity (Governance, Risk, Audit Readiness, Responsible AI): Builds governance architecture and evidence cycles across PCI, NIST, HIPAA, SOC 2, HECVAT, NIST AI RMF, and TX-RAMP, embedding technical controls into operations and extending the same discipline to Responsible AI through policy, model risk, vendor oversight, and audit-ready artifacts.
- Technical Program Director (Modernization, Multi-team Delivery, AI implementation): Architects transformation programs, not just project plans, coordinating modernization across cloud, infrastructure, identity, security, and compliance, including AI initiatives from intake to rollout with risk gating, orchestration, operationalization, and measurable outcomes tied to risk reduction and business value.

### Architectural Strengths

- Conceptual, logical, and physical architecture modeling that makes complexity executable
- System, data, and identity mapping across business and technology domains
- Current-state to future-state roadmaps that connect architecture to delivery sequencing
- Cloud, identity, segmentation, and security patterns for regulated environments
- AI-enabled architecture: safe integration patterns for data flows, access boundaries, and platform services
- Visual modeling and “decision support diagrams” for executives and cross-functional teams
- Translating business intent into technical models that teams can build and operate

### Governance, Risk, and Modernization Execution

- Builds governance that operates: policies to controls to evidence, on a predictable cadence
- Translates frameworks into execution (PCI, NIST, HIPAA, SOC 2, HECVAT, TX-RAMP) with embedded technical controls
- Establishes risk-based prioritization and modernization sequencing for highest-risk, highest-value.
- Creates audit-ready artifacts and operating rhythms that scale across teams and vendors
- Drives modernization programs across cloud, infrastructure, identity, and security with measurable risk reduction
- Extends governance discipline to Responsible AI: use-case intake, risk gating, vendor oversight, and documentation that stands up to review

### Operating Model and Leadership Approach

I lead with structure and outcomes. I start by mapping the current state (people, process, technology, risk), define a practical future state, and build a roadmap that teams can execute. My work style is visual and decision-driven: I use architecture models to align stakeholders, expose dependencies, and translate requirements into buildable, audit-ready solutions. Whether I’m leading modernization, GRC, or AI initiatives, I focus on repeatable governance, measurable risk reduction, and delivery cadence that sticks.  My approach is grounded in formal enterprise architecture methods and years of leading cross-functional delivery in complex environments.

Architecture is not something I do. It is how I think.

### Representative Results

- Designed and executed enterprise and solution architectures that aligned business, security, and technology teams around a single future-state model and delivery roadmap.
- Established governance and evidence cycles that reduced audit friction and enabled continuous compliance across regulated environments.
- Led modernization initiatives spanning cloud, infrastructure, identity, and security with measurable risk reduction and operational readiness improvements.
- Built and operationalized GRC programs that embedded controls into day-to-day operations rather than treating compliance as a periodic event.
- Guided AI initiatives from intake through implementation with risk-aware architecture, governance guardrails, and audit-ready documentation.
- Acted as the connective tissue between executives, engineers, security, and delivery teams to move complex initiatives from intent to execution across multiple business units.

### How I’m Typically Engaged

Organizations bring me in to create clarity and momentum in complex, high-risk initiatives. My typical engagement includes:
- Assessing current-state architecture, risk posture, and operating model
- Defining future-state models and prioritized roadmaps
- Establishing governance and delivery cadence across teams
- Partnering with executives and technical leaders to drive alignment
- Staying engaged through execution to ensure outcomes hold
- Producing decision-ready models and diagrams that make tradeoffs visible and execution measurable

I deliver the most value in environments with aligned leadership, clear accountability, and a culture that values clarity, integrity, mentorship, and continuous improvement. Best fit: roles with real scope where architecture-first governance and modernization translate into measurable outcomes.

### AI Focus (Architecture + Governance)

- AI use-case intake and prioritization with risk-based gating and business alignment
- Responsible AI governance: policy, controls, model risk, vendor oversight, and audit-ready artifacts
- AI-enabled architecture patterns: data flows, identity, segmentation, and shared platform services
- Operationalization of AI: monitoring, change control, and evidence trails that hold under audit
- Technology-agnostic AI conceptual frameworks and shared ontology work to standardize language, decision models, and governance across vendors and platforms
